**"tailoryourRevit core"** is a Revit external application which loads your F# codes into the program as a toolbar tab and **instantly compile** your code without restarting your Revit environment, right after you saved your just debugged script. Furthermore, working tightly with Visual Studio Community, **tyRCore** lets you not only own the efficiency of the instant compiliation but also have the usual assembly building, while taking the advantage of coding with the Intellisense autocompletion.
