As we all know, or at least I felt, programming is gaining its popularity.  
It's happening, whether one like it or not, having programming as a skill is necessary on one's path of life. It's not about one's carrier - not at all - but it's improving your living efficiency.  
Why?  
You might not see it coming apparently but it's changing gradually.  
At the first time that I had the first contact to a computer, it was for me a black box. I knew nothing about it. Until now, 23 years later, I can program codes to commuicate with a computer and ask it to work or to test a concept for me liberally. By "liberally", I meant the freedom from constrained by the frames created by the other programmers. I now can programm these frames for my own and if I have a new thought, which is a huge burden for human culculation, I can ask it to do this repeating process for me just within a second and I acquire the result and can do the next step or even try more times. All of these progresses couldn't be imagined by the me 23 years ago.  
I'm just one of the many programmers. They are getting more and more, because the programmes are getting more complicated and intellegent. So intellegent can people like me learn to programm. The future of programming will be that most of us can more or less programm at some level (and actually everyone of us is programming already, if you have your smartphone in your hand and customise it as you wish). This is inevidable. Since programming is not some kind of magical skill owned only by those who went to certain schools but by learning from the huge information pool on the internet every single of us can have, little or short scripts will be everywhere and in my opinion, the long and complex codes should be left for those who went to the certain schools, and we, the amateurs, will write some "instant scripts" at needs. This short scripts don't need much of maintaince, if they need it at all. The point is to write them at once, quickly and simple, since we will not only need the computer to do one kind of work everytime we think to run a code, but through time, the need or the structure, on which the codes are based on, can change, and the maintaince will be huge work when it comes to the long script just for a small change, but the maintaince will be shorter at searching and re-understanding the old code, when the codes are shorter. However, step by step, a complex function can be built-up by many of the short steps as short scripts.
